## Configuration & Requirements

## Function & Usage

### Matching 
It helps you find intersection between variables available through your application and (almost) all other UKB advertised through https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/

### Dictionary 
It acts as a dictionary, you can pass a variable Field ID and it will return the variable name and its category (by category I mean *UKbiobank* pre-defined categories.)
